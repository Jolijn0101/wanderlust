# Wanderlust project

<br>

## Description:

This project is an search engine for finding great places to visit in a particular city or village. The idea of this project comes from Codecademy were I study the front-end engineer path. I took this project off of code cademy and customized it a bit. I have made a homepage and the page will change after clicking on the submit button. After clicking on the submit button the background will shrink and change in a photo of the city or village you searched for. Under the background there are ten cards with recommendations to visit in or nearby the city or village you searched for.

<br>

## How to use:

This project is made with a foursquare api to get the information about the places. You need a api key and client secret to use this project. Copy this repository and make an account on: https://foursquare.com/developers/login Copy the client secret and api key and paste them in the main.js file. There are screenshots attached in this readme so you can have already an idea how the project looks like.

## Feedback

It was an interesting project to make and challenging to customise. I removed the weather api and added more recamondations for places to visit. The layout has also changed a bit. The outline of the submit button had changed and the inputfield is more visible know. Making the title and the form even more visible I added a blue overlay over the background.

Would be nice to learn from it.
